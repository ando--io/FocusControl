# FocusControl

A small tool to control USBFocus from a mac. This app is freely inspired by the USBTelescopeController app available on the company website.

To use, download, pod install and compile. 

this is an early version able to control one or more devices but that does not save the configuration on disk. You'll have to defien the device each time, menu + new.
